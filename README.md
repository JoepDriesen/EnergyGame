# EnergyGame
Submission for the Koding Hackathon 2016 - An educational game about energy generation and conversion installations.

What's this?
---
This is a puzzle game that puts the player in the shoes of an engineer designing a power plant. Through 
investigation and experimentation, the player must try to achieve the design goals. In doing so, they will hopefully learn
something new about power generation and conversion, some of the most important technologies of our society!

Obviously this is a vast simplification of the real deal, partly due to the time constraint of the hackathon, partly
to keep it simple enough for a layman to understand what is going on.


How to play
---
* Drag components from to bottom of the screen onto the blue workspace to use them in your schematic
* Right click on inputs/outputs to connect them
* Click on a component on the workspace to see its working parameters and change them if possible
* Try to achieve all the goals!
