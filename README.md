# EnergyGame
Submission for the Koding Hackathon 2016 - An educational game about energy generation and conversion installations.

What's this?
---
This is a puzzle game that puts the player in the shoes of an engineer designing a power plant. Through 
investigation and experimentation, the player must try to achieve the design goals.

Obviously this is a vast simplification of the real deal, partly due to the time constraint of the hackathon, partly
to keep it simple enough for a layman to understand what is going on.


How to play
---
* Drag components from to bottom of the screen onto the blue workspace to use them in your schematic
* Right click on inputs/outputs to connect them
* Click on a component on the workspace to see its working parameters and change them if possible
* Try to achieve all the goals!
